# Introduction 
This is for anybody who's wrecked the rotator cuff, dislocated a shoulder, broken an arm, or anything where you're not going to be able to use one of your arms for an extended period of time. In my case, mountain biking? It could be from anything. 
One of the things they don't warn you about is all the stuff you're going to need to buy for at home just to make living with a single arm and an immobilized arm actually workable for day-to-day life. 
Tons of things you'll take for granted are actually much more difficult when you don't have an arm. It does depend a little bit if it's your dominant arm and not. And somewhat differentially if it's your right arm or your left arm as well. The last one sounds a little bit odd, but it's because there aren't very many things like mice and controllers for left-handed people. 

## Clothing 
Underwear and socks are somewhat uncomplicated. You'll get used to it over a little bit. Nothing to say there. 
Shorts and trousers. You're going to need to put these on with one hand. At least in the early days, you're going to want training shorts, track pads, stuff with a drawstring. 
Short-sleeve, fully buttoned-up shirts are the easiest to get over your arm when you're getting in and out of a sling and you can't really move your arm. 
You are also going to want a fully zipped-up jumper. At least in the first days, you are going to be wearing one of the arms draped over you, and you are not going to be able to get a 3/4 or pull-over on. 
Fully zipped up gilets are also a good idea. 

### Shoes
I'm South African, so I live in slops - known as flip-flops here. That works fine for summer, but you're going to need some shoes you can get on and off relatively easily. 
I got slip-on vans, for casual wear.

And some loafers on special to just about pass at work. [Loafers](https://www.houseoffraser.co.uk/brand/ted-baker/ted-mens-loafer-sn99-111509#colcode=11150903)
And then I got a pair of trail running shoes that have Boa closures, so I can put them on one-handed.

### Specialised clothing
Going for a check-up at the surgeon and going for physio. Things like that are going to be more complicated than you expect. 
There are these adaptive T-shirts that you can use which Velcro open for when you need a physio or a surgeon to look at your shoulder. [Velcro shirts. ](https://www.adaptiveapparel.co.uk/store/3-Pack-Side-Opening-T-Shirts-Broken-Arm-Clothing-p530055400)


## Sleeping
This is going to be way more complex than you ever expected. Firstly, you can't actually sleep flat on your back. For a couple of reasons, one of which is that the sling and/or [Don Joy](https://www.healthandcare.co.uk/shoulder-supports/donjoy-ultrasling-pro.html?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22893795054&gbraid=0AAAAAD7hp2pJyVAZhBQUpULUAVjEJXQWh&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_rPGBhCbARIsABjq9cdNNi-MB3HmEvYK-l23HkXRJf03_Q2myXzs6R-KP_okoSBFtF8179gaArR4EALw_wcB) immobilization device is going to roll up if you're flat on your back. Not only is this gonna hurt and wake you up, it's also gonna cause damage to any repairs in the front of your shoulder. Your arm is also meant to be in a very specific position in terms of rotation, internal or external. And so you're probably going to want a pillow or something underneath your elbow to stop your arm from falling out of position. And finally, if you don't want to just sleep on your back all night and like to roll over like I do, on the side you can roll over onto, you're probably also going to want a pillow so that when you roll over your arm doesn't rotate out of position in that direction. 

This is the slightly awkward Fortress sleeping position I have. Firstly, a wedge pillow to keep you at least a little bit upright. The thing I'd say about the Wedge pillow is to get one of those that have a neck support as well. And then that triangular pull out works better for me for keeping the elbow upright than the normal pillow. 

One different trick that I've found is using a travel pillow around the actual sling to stop it rolling upwards if you have to sleep on your back.
